## Overview
The "Product Preview Card Component" challenge from Frontend Mentor is a web development challenge designed to improve our skills in building responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Here's an overview of the challenge:

### Challenge Description:

**Objective:** Create a product preview card component based on the provided design.

**Design:** Frontend Mentor provides a design in the form of images (desktop and mobile views) and sometimes a design file (like Figma or Sketch) that serves as a reference for how the final product should look.

**Responsive Design:** The challenge typically requires a responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Assets:** The challenge often includes images and icons that we need to incorporate into our project. These assets are usually provided along with the challenge.

**Details:** The design specifications include details such as typography, colors, spacing, and layout. Paying attention to these details is crucial for accurately reproducing the design.

### Key Skills Tested:

**HTML & CSS:** We'll need to structure the HTML document according to the design and apply styles using CSS.

**Responsive Design:** Ensuring that the card component looks good and functions well across various screen sizes and devices is a key aspect of the challenge.

**Flexbox/Grid Layout:** These layout techniques are often used to create a responsive and flexible design.

**Typography:** Implementing the correct fonts, font sizes, and styles according to the design specifications.

**Image Handling:** Incorporating images into our project as per the design.

**Interactivity:** Depending on the challenge, we might need to include interactive elements like buttons or hover effects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
